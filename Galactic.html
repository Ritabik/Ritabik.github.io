        <section class="container my-5 text-light" id="galactic-dynamo-theory">
            <h2 class="text-center mb-5 mnras">Galactic Dynamo Theory</h2>
            <div class="row align-items-center">
                <p>
                    Galactic dynamo theory serves as a cornerstone in explaining the amplification and maintenance of galactic magnetic fields. Dynamo processes involve the conversion of kinetic energy from fluid motions within a galaxy into magnetic energy. The theoretical foundation of dynamo theory is rooted in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, which describe the behavior of electrically conducting fluids, such as the ionized gas present in the interstellar medium.
                </p>

                <p>Mathematically, the evolution of the magnetic field (\( \mathbf{B} \)) in a galactic environment can be expressed through the induction equation:</p>

                \[
                    \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} - \eta \nabla
                    \times
                    \mathbf{B})
                \]
                <ol>
                    <li>When \( \eta \) is much larger than 1 (\( \eta \gg 1 \)): \[ \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \approx -\eta \nabla^{2}\mathbf{B} \] In this scenario, the evolution of the magnetic field (\( \mathbf{B} \)) is predominantly governed by magnetic diffusion. Large \( \eta \) values lead to rapid dissipation of magnetic field structures, resulting in a diffusion-dominated regime.
                    </li>

                    <li>When \( \eta \) is much smaller than 1 (\( \eta \ll 1 \)):

                        \[
                            \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \approx \nabla \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
                        \]

                        In this regime, the induction equation is primarily influenced by the advective and rotationalterms (\(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \)), with magnetic diffusion playing a minor role. Smaller \( \eta\) values allow magnetic field structures to evolve more freely.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>To provide a concrete example, let us consider the mean-field dynamo theory, which describes the evolution of the mean magnetic field \(\overline{B}\) and the small-scale magnetic fluctuations (\( \mathbf{b} \)). The governing equations are given by:</p>
                <p>
                    \[
                        \frac{\partial \overline{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times (\overline{\mathbf{v}} \times \overline{B}
                        +
                        \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}} - \eta( \nabla \times \overline{B}))
                    \]
                </p>

                <p>where \(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}} \approx \overline{{v} \times \mathbf{b}}\).</p>
                <p>
                    The mean field induction equation lies at the heart of galactic magnetohydrodynamics, describing the evolution of the mean magnetic field with a nuanced interplay of forces. The term \( \frac{\partial \overline{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} \) delineates the temporal changes in the mean magnetic field, shaped by intricate interactions. The component \( \nabla \times (\overline{\mathbf{v}} \times \overline{\mathbf{B}}) \) embodies the induction driven by fluid motions, contributing to the amplification of the mean magnetic field. Additionally, the electromotive force \( \mathbf{E} \) introduces complexity, arising from turbulent motions within the galactic medium.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the term \( - \eta \nabla \times \overline{\mathbf{B}} \) introduces magnetic diffusion, where \( \eta \) represents the magnetic diffusivity. In scenarios with a significantly large \( \eta \), magnetic diffusion dominates, resulting in a damping effect on variations in the mean magnetic field. Conversely, when \( \eta \) is small, the influence of magnetic diffusion diminishes, allowing fluid motions and turbulent processes to exert a more pronounced role in shaping the evolution of the mean magnetic field. This delicate balance between induction, electromotive forces, and magnetic diffusion intricately governs the behavior of galactic magnetic fields, revealing the captivating dynamics within the vast cosmic landscape.

            <div class="row align-items-center">
                <p>These are some numerical methods to solve any differential equation</p>
        <h3><u>Time-Stepping Routine: Explicit Euler Method</u></h3>

        <p>
            In numerical simulations, the explicit Euler method is a simple time-stepping algorithm. It updates the
            solution at each time step using the formula:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">
            \[ u_{n+1} = u_n + \Delta t \cdot f(u_n, t_n) \]
        </div>

        <p>
            Here:
        <ul>
            <li>\( u_{n+1} \) is the solution at the next time step.</li>
            <li>\( u_n \) is the solution at the current time step.</li>
            <li>\( \Delta t \) is the time step size.</li>
            <li>\( f(u_n, t_n) \) represents the derivative of \( u \) with respect to time at \( t_n \).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3><u>Finite Differencing Routine: Central Difference Scheme</u></h3>

        <p>
            In numerical simulations, the central difference scheme is a finite differencing method used to approximate
            second-order spatial derivatives. For a function \( u \) with respect to space (\( x \)), the central
            difference formula for the second derivative is given by:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">
            \[ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} \]
        </div>

        <p>
            Here:
        <ul>
            <li>\( u_{i+1} \) is the value at the grid point to the right.</li>
            <li>\( u_i \) is the value at the current grid point.</li>
            <li>\( u_{i-1} \) is the value at the grid point to the left.</li>
            <li>\( \Delta x \) represents the spatial grid spacing.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3><u>Runge-Kutta Method</u></h3>



        <p>
            The Runge-Kutta method is a widely used numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations
            (ODEs). It provides a more accurate solution compared to simpler methods like Euler's method. The
            fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, denoted as RK4, is particularly popular due to its balance between accuracy
            and computational efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
            The general formulation of the RK4 method involves four steps:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">
            \[ k_1 = h \cdot f(x_n, y_n) \]
            \[ k_2 = h \cdot f(x_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_1}{2}) \]
            \[ k_3 = h \cdot f(x_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_2}{2}) \]
            \[ k_4 = h \cdot f(x_n + h, y_n + k_3) \]
            \[ y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4) \]
        </div>

        <p>
            Here, \(x_n\) and \(y_n\) are the current values of the independent and dependent variables, respectively.
            \(h\) is the step size, and \(f(x, y)\) is the given function defining the ODE. The RK4 method offers a good
            compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of
            applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            The method is particularly valuable in physics, engineering, and other fields where differential equations
            model dynamic systems. Its efficiency comes from the iterative nature of the calculations, allowing for the
            approximation of complex solutions. Researchers and engineers often use RK4 when analytical solutions are
            difficult or impossible to obtain.
        </p>

        <p>
            In conclusion, the Runge-Kutta method, especially RK4, is a powerful numerical tool for solving ordinary
            differential equations. Its accuracy and efficiency make it a staple in the computational toolbox of
            scientists and engineers, contributing to advancements in various scientific disciplines.

            <p>To demonstrate the amplification of magnetic energy through the coupling of α and Ω terms in our equation, we include them as follows:</p>

<p>
\[
\frac{\partial B_r}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (\alpha B_{\phi}) + \eta_t \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r B_r) \right) + \frac{\partial^2 B_r}{\partial z^2} \right],

\[
\frac{\partial B_{\phi}}{\partial t} = -q\Omega B_r - \eta_t \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r B_{\phi}) \right) + \frac{\partial^2 B_{\phi}}{\partial z^2} \right]
\]

<br>

<p>We assume α to be constant, while Ω has the functional form:</p>

\[
\Omega = \Omega_0 \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{r}{R_0} \right)^2}
