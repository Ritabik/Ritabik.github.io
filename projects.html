		<h3>1. The quenching of star formation by massive bulges in disk galaxies<br> [Indian Institute of Astrophysics(IIA), Bangalore, India
(PI:Dr. Mousumi Das - Observational Astrophysics)]</h3>
            <p>Early type spiral galaxies and some SO galaxies are found to have large, massive bulges.
These bulges can make the disks of their host galaxies kinematically hotter just because they
make the potential much deeper in the center of the galaxy, resulting in an increase of the
disk stellar velocity dispersion. Hotter disks are less likely to support star formation mainly
because they do not form global disk instabilities like bars and spiral arms.</p>
<p> In this project we have tested this hypothesis by using the galaxy sample S4G. The bulge

to disk ratio for galaxies is tabulated along with the galaxy masses, colours. We will com-
pare the bulge to disk ratio with the galaxy colours, star formation rates and specific star

formation rates.Here we have used the S4G to calculate the bulge-to-disk mass ratio and to
calculate the SFR we have used the GALEX data.All the datas and results are verified from
the previous papers published.</p>

		<h3>2. Identifying double peaked emission lines and AGN pairs in a sample of merging galaxies from the GOTHIC survey<br> [Indian Institute of Astrophysics(IIA), Bangalore, India
(PI:Dr. Mousumi Das - Observational Astrophysics)]</h3>
            <p>Galaxy mergers are powerful drivers of galaxy evolution and galaxy growth. As galaxies
merge their nuclei come closer together and may finally be enclosed within a single envelope.
This is called a dual nuclei galaxy. The individual galaxy nuclei can be either starburst (very
large star formation rates), star forming or AGN in nature. If the nuclei are very close their
emission lines will overlap and they will be double peaked. However double peaked emission
lines are also due to outflows from star formation or AGN, or can be due to a rotating disk of
hot ionized gas.</p>
<p>In this project we have examined the spectra from the GOTHIC survey, where both nuclei

lie within a single fibre. After determining the sample of double nuclei galaxies we will in-
vestigate the origin of the double peaks.The optical spectra and images of the galaxies are

collected and analysed from the SDSS skyserver.Generally we have used the optical spec-
tras of the galaxies to analyse the reason behind the double peaks in emission lines.</p>

		<h3>1. Simulation and Construction of RPC Detectors<br>[National Institute of Science Education and Research(NISER),Bhubaneshwar,India,School
of Physiacl Sciences(PI:Prof. Bedangadas Mohanty-Experimental High Energy Physics)]
		<p>Worked on the project of RPC Detectors,RPC Detectors are used in detection of cosmic
muons.These further helps in the muography techniques,here I have learned the basics of
Detector physics working ,contruction etc.Mainly focused on the gaseous Detectors.Here I
have learned how to make demo structures of detectors in COMSOL Multiphysics,I have
creatyed a simple structure of RPC model and calculated the elctric fields and potential in
the gaps of the RPC detectors.</p>

<p>Simulations like Garfield++ are also used to create the detectors in a appropriate man-
ner.I have learned the basics of Garfield ++ also.Learns about the different types of soft-
wares used in calculation of different parameters like HEED is used to calculate the En-
ergy,Magboltz as Baic structures etc.
            </p>
	<h3>2. Estimating the concentration and ploting the Co-existence curve at Phase Transition<br>[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research(IISER),Kolkata,India-741246,Depart
of Physical Sciences,(PI:Dr. Arindam Kundagrami-Theoretical Soft Condesed Matter
Physics)]
<p>Works on the topic of Polymer Physics and Phase transitions.I have learn about the topics
of of soft matter physisc like langevin method,einsteinien method,Brownian motion,Phase
Transition etc.</p>
<p>So we have calculated the concetration at which the phase transition occurs and made the
co-existence curve of a solution having an arbitrary polymer and solvent(like water).We have
used computational methods to solve the solution of free energy.The free energy solution is
minimized by using the computational methods and the co-existence curve is produced.</p>

<h3>3. Reading project on Leptogenesis and Baryogenesis<br>[Joint Institute of Nuclear Research(JINR),Dubna,Moscow,Russia
(PI:Dr. Chitta Ranjan Das-Theoretical Astrophysics)]
<p>Learns about the concepts of Universe inflation also some parts of gravitational lensing,which

in the period of leptogenesis and baryogenesis creates a asymmetry in the particle and an-
tiparticle in the whole universe.It is very much interesting to understand the basic elementary

particle physics model.</p>
<p> I have mainly study on the cosmological properties of the evolution of the universe and the
growth of large-scale structures. The growth of large-scale structures is related to the nature
of dark matter.</p>
